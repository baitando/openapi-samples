# Spring Boot Server

This is the REST API provider application, which is implemented with Spring Boot.
Some parts of the code are generated by Swagger Codegen based on the OpenAPI specification.

Please run `./mvnw compile` to trigger the code generation first.
Afterwards, you can simply run the server application by starting the Spring Boot application.
A server will start up and listen on port 8080.
Once started, you can simply access http://localhost:8080/accounts with your browser.

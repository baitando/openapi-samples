# Spring Boot Client

This is the REST API consumer application, which is implemented with Spring Boot.
It provides a website, which lists all the accounts retrieved from the server
Some parts of the code are generated by Swagger Codegen based on the OpenAPI specification.

Please run `./mvnw compile` to trigger the code generation first.
Then please start the Spring Boot server.
Once the server is ready, you can simply run the client application by starting the Spring Boot application.
It will connect to the Spring Boot server to retrieve some data, which is visualized on http://localhost:9000/accounts.
